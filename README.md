1.This is a personal website for a D&D (dungeons and dragons) champaign that I am working on called "Fortune's Bounty".Its purpose is to store information about the campaign into a single place that I can access.The info stored would be lore and notes on the champaign with images of maps and npcs.The targeted audience would be fans of D&D and people who are interested in playing D&D.The webiste would be called "Fortune's Bounty.com"
2.The website's three goals would be:1.To store info for my D&D champaign, "Hunter's Fortune".2 To promote the champaign. 3 To maybe help others make their own champaigns
Other aditions could be stat blocks for custom made creatures, battle maps, and a user feedback feature so people can give suggestions on what to improve.
